# simple-html-and-css

Adapt the HTML and CSS to match this design:

![Goal](goal.png)

![Goal Phone](mobile-first-float.gif)

The stuff you'll stumble on and learn this week includes:
- Mobile-first CSS styles
	- Write CSS that works for mobile, then override for desktop in Media Queries
- CSS Floats layout
- Fixed header
- Installing the iOS simulator

HINT:
- Use _box-sizing: border-box;_ on your floated elements (.side)

Ignore index-positioning.html and position-styles.css for now.
